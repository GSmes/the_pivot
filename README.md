# The Pivot
The Pivot is a Turing School of Software and Design Module 3 group project.

This brownfield project is built off of the repo [One Fan's Treasure](https://github.com/Laner12/little_shop), which was an exploration into e-commerce with Rails. CRUD, authorization, and authentication were all fully utilized in that project to allow a user to create an account, purchase items, and receive confirmation. An administrator has additional privileges (i.e., the ability to edit their account).

Extensions in One Fan's Treasure included e-mail confirmation, Stripe for payment processing, OAuth (Twitter), image upload and storage via Paperclip and AWS, and dynamic search.
